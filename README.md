Scott RPG - Version: 1.3.9: 

1. Updated gender choice
2. Added defaults if players fail to enter a choice during character creation(Default race is human, default class is swordsman, and default magic type is Fire)
3. Updated smithing so players can now customize the items they smith(they will still have the same stats as their recipes but players can now nickname items and set the level required to wield them in turn giving players reason to use the system, and for now it only works on swords)
