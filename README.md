Scott RPG Current Version: 1.3.1

Update Includes: 
1. This update focuses soley on the vampire races gameplay, as we have to perfect it:
   Added a blood stat to the vampire race, now they have to drink blood when in battle to regain stamina and/or mana, blood drains by 10 every move meaning that the player will constantly have a need for blood as a debuff to the vampire race they cannot use potions, only drink blood to regain their stamina and/or mana
