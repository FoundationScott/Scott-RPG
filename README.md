# Scott RPG - Version: 1.4.2: 

1. Added hunger and thirst valves and updated shopkeeper to have a 'Buy food and/or drinks' option, food will fill the hunger valve and drinks the thirst valve food and drinks will both be under one shop category and their will be different foods/drinks which restore a different amount of hunger and thirst and players can eventually die from starvation or dehydration. Naturally vampires don't need to worry about hunger or thirst.

3. Fixed gerald(the blacksmith).
4. Updated the guide

6. Fixed player death system
